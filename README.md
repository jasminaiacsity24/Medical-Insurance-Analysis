US Medical Insurance Cost Analysis


Project Overview:

This project analyzes a dataset of medical insurance costs to understand the factors that influence healthcare expenses. The analysis was performed using Python, pandas, and data visualization.


Dataset:

The dataset contains information about 1,338 individuals, including:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Annual medical charges


Analysis Performed:

The project investigates:
- Average age of patients
- Average medical charges
- Distribution of patients by region
- Comparison of medical costs between smokers and non-smokers
- Relationship between BMI and medical charges
- Relationship between age and medical charges
- Impact of having children on medical expenses


Key Insights:

- The average age of patients is around 40 years.
- Smokers have significantly higher medical costs than non-smokers. Smoking is one of the strongest drivers of medical expenses in the dataset.
- BMI shows only a weak relationship with medical costs, meaning it is not a strong predictor on its own.
- Age has a clearer relationship with medical expenses, with older individuals generally having higher costs.
- The number of children has some impact on medical charges, but it is less significant than smoking status.


Tools Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
